# Button Simple

Buttons make common actions more obvious and help users more easily perform them. Buttons use labels and sometimes icons to communicate the action that will occur when the user touches them.

## Best practices

- Group buttons logically into sets based on usage and importance.
- Ensure that button actions are clear and consistent.

## Properties

<Props of={Button} />

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <Button />
  <Button text="React"/>
  <Button text="DocZ"/>
</Playground>
